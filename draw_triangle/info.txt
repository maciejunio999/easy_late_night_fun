Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from
three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.
Example:
    Input: nums = [2,1,2,3]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 2, 2, and 3.

If three sides of a triangle are given, which is known as SSS (side-side-side), you can use the Law of
cosines to solve for the angles.

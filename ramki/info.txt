Objective:
    The project aims to analyze an image, identify global extremes in pixel values,
    and draw a square around the detected regions of interest. Additionally, it determains
    if the image is mostly white and adapts the extreme value calculation accordingly.

Modules:
    main.py and main2.py:
        Usage:
            Initialize with the path to the photo.
            Extract pixels from a cropped version of the image.
            Analyze pixel values and find global extremes.
            Draw a square around identified regions.

    main_math.py:
        Functionality:
            Provides mathematical operations for data analysis.
            Implements the calculation of global extremes and detection of significant changes in
            pixel values.
            Ensures proper handling for images that are mostly white.

    square_draw.py:
        Functionality:
            Utilizes the Pillow library to draw a square on an image.
            Accepts start and end coordinates, color, and thickness for customization.
            Provides a visual representation of detected regions of interest.

    white.py:
        Functionality:
            Checks if an image is mostly white.
            Uses a specified threshold for pixel brightness.
            Returns a boolean value indicating whether the majority of pixels are considered white.


How to Use:
    main.py and main2.py:
        Update the PHOTO_PATH variable with the path to your image.
        Run the script.

    main_math.py:
        Handles mathematical operations and data analysis.
        Used by main.py for detecting extremes and significant changes in pixel values.

    square_draw.py:
        Provides the draw_square function to visually represent detected regions.
        Used by main.py for drawing squares on the image.

    white.py:
        Utilized by main.py to determain if the image is mostly white.
        Customize the threshold parameter to adjust sensitivity.


Dependencies:
    Pillow library (pip install Pillow)


Notes:
    The project is designed to work with images where regions of interest are defined by significant changes in pixel values.
    Ensure the Pillow library is installed (pip install Pillow).
    Adjust the threshold in white.py for different image conditions.


Conclusion:
    The project offers a modular and adaptable solution for analyzing and visualizing significant
    regions in images, considering variations in pixel values and the overall brightness of the image.
    The implementation is straightforward, making it easy to use and extend.


main.py vs main2.py:
    Key diference is that for mine2 we can get more drastic results, what doest it mean? It simply means
    that for some images the square might be much smaller and the code determines to catch bigger changes
    in pixels.
